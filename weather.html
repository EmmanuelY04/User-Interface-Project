    <h2>London Weather Forecast for Playing Basketball</h2>
    <p> The weather recommendation system does not work because on openweathermap the free api access does not give me access to future weather forecasts, you have to pay for better versions and there was not that many other feasible ways to code the weather forecast. But you can look at the code to see that it is correct.</p>
